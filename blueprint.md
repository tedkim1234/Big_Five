# Big Five Personality Test Website

## Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to take a Big Five personality test. The application will present a series of questions, calculate the user's scores for the five personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), and provide detailed interpretations of the results.

## Implemented Features

*   **Interactive Questionnaire:** A set of questions based on the Big Five model.
*   **Automated Scoring:** The application automatically calculates the scores for each trait based on the user's answers.
*   **Detailed Results:** The results page displays the score for each trait along with a comprehensive explanation of what the score means.
*   **Modern UI:** The application has a clean, modern, and responsive user interface.

## Current Plan

This is the first version of the application. The plan is to create the initial HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript logic to implement the core functionality of the personality test.
